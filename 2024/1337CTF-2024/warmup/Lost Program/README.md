I was working on a bug bounty program the other day but I completely forgot the name!! I guess that will teach me not to use emoji notation in future 😩 Anyway, if you could help me find it again, I'd really appreciate it! Here's my notes..

TODO: find lots of 😎🐛 on 🥷🥝🎮

Hint: flag format = INTIGRITI{company_name}

https://go.intigriti.com/programs
```

Using https://www.iemoji.com/ getting output of : `😎🐛 on 🥷🥝🎮`

We see a kiwi and going back to https://www.intigriti.com/bug-bounty-programs control find `kiwi` and we get Ninja Kiwi Games Bug Bounty program.

Flag just wants company name so flag : `INTIGRITI{Ninja_Kiwi}`
